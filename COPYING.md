I'm releasing this under three licenses (GPLv3, AGPL3, and MIT) in this 
particular case because my working theory is that making a p2p **library** 
easier to use for more people will hurt centralization more, and I'm leaving it up 
to you to decide which will help you better to achieve that primary goal with 
your particular **application**.

That being said, in case you intend to submit contributions, it will be easier for
me to incorporate changes if you license them back to me as MIT.
Since you can easily clone and vendor-in anything I produce, that shouldn't be
a limitation to you anyway.

See terms for each license under the files:

[MIT license](./LICENSE)

[GNU General Public License v3](./LICENSE.gplv3)

[GNU Affero Public License v3](./LICENSE.agpl3)

If licencing terms are confusing to you and you don't want to spend any time
learning about legal matters, just use this under the terms of the MIT license, 
which is compatible with almost anything else.

[MIT license](./LICENSE)

For the discerning coder who already understands the implications of software licencing,
I'm releasing this under three licenses (GPLv3, AGPL3, and MIT) in this 
particular case because my working theory is that making a p2p **library** 
easier to use for more people will hurt centralization more, and I'm leaving it up 
to you to decide which will help you better to achieve that primary goal with 
your particular **application**.

All your freedoms will be thoroughly respected if you choose one of the Libre licences,
and that option is available to you if you abide by the terms of the GPLv3 or the AGPLv3.

That being said, in case you intend to submit contributions, it will be easier for
me to incorporate changes if you license them back to me as MIT.
Since you can easily clone and vendor-in anything I produce, that shouldn't be
a limitation to you anyway.

See terms for each license under the files:

[MIT license](./LICENSE)

[GNU General Public License v3](./LICENSE.gplv3)

[GNU Affero Public License v3](./LICENSE.agpl3)
